## About the Project

**PH Tube** is an educational project that delves deep into the realm of APIs, enabling you to access video content dynamically. Through this project, you've honed your skills in using APIs to gather video information, including video titles, thumbnails, view counts, channel names, upload times, and more.

### Key Features

✨ **Dynamic Video Display**: With the help of the `createHTML` method in JavaScript, this project provides a seamless UI for dynamically presenting video data to users. Each video's details are rendered on the page, offering a user-friendly experience.

📈 **Data Sorting**: You've learned to sort video content based on view counts. The project takes view counts in the format '335K', converts them into numerical values, and sorts the entire array of video objects in descending order. Users can initiate this sorting process with a "Sort by Views" button.

📱 **Responsive Design**: PH Tube is designed to be responsive, ensuring an optimal viewing experience on all devices, from mobile phones and tablets to desktop computers.

📁 **Categorized Content**: Videos are categorized into different tabs, such as General, Music, Comedy, and Drawing, offering users a structured and engaging experience.
